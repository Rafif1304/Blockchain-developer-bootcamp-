contract MyContract {
    function foo() external {}
    function bar() external {}
}

In MyContract, why does foo() use more gas than bar(), even though their code is the same?

these two function theoretically and functionally have the same gas optimization, 
but practically may have some differences in type of compiler, function compressing, or minor differencies
of hash. Those minor things can give an impact to contract gas optimization.
